- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ker7
- 👀 I’m interested in Change, Learning, Harmony and Optim(al)ism.
-    My Code Babies:
-    1) Time Direction Management | Energy Focusing Helperwheel for Ultra-Open people like myself (LaravelPHP)
-    2) 50+ of game/game mechanics prototypes written in GameMaker Engine (it's where I entered coding)
-    3) To emphasize the point one, so far  have I finished a Pong game and a conversation-game (at a 48h gamejam)
-    4) Websites on Wordpress working with Custom Theme Design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Clang, App development, Music production and Flow in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Awareness & Data Visualizations.
- 📫 You can reach me via kert.mottus@gmail.com or ::fb:Kert Mõttus
