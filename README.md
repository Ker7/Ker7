- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ker7
- 👀 I’m interested in Harmony, Growth and Optimistm
-     My Code Babies:
-     1) Time Direction Management | Energy Focusing Helperwheel for Ultra-Open people like myself (LaravelPHP)
-     2) 50+ of game/game mechanics prototypes written in GameMaker Engine (it's where I entered coding)
-     3) To emphasize 1), alone have I finished a Pong clone and a conversational game (48h gamejam)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Clang, App development, Music production and Order.
