- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ker7
- 👀 I’m interested in Harmony, Growth and Optimistm
-    My Code Babies:
-    1) Time Direction Management | Energy Focusing Helperwheel for Ultra-Open people like myself (LaravelPHP)
-    2) 50+ of game/game mechanics prototypes written in GameMaker Engine (it's where I entered coding)
-    3) To emphasize i. so far alone have I finished a Pong clone and a conversational game (48h gamejam) (I even came to study C atm and came to pull my C bank from here and saw the update possibility for the profile README.md file which seems fun and imporant somehow too, but my C studies suffer...)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Clang, App development, Music production and Order.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Awareness & Data Visualizations.
- 📫 You can reach me via kert.mottus@gmail.com or ::fb:Kert Mõttus
