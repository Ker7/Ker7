- 👀 I’m interested in Joy. For me it means Pleasure of (any) Experience, Learning & Harmony.
      Optim(al)ism and appropriate Pessimism for Wholeness!
      I am of type Projector. My upbringing has kept my curious child alive.
      I am fulfilling my dreams and helping other's on the same path we all are: SelfRealization and Integration.

-    2) **(gd_*)** 50+ of game prototypes written in GameMaker Language (it's how I entered the coding world, is my python..)
-    3) To emphasize the point one, so far  have I finished a Pong game and a conversation-game (at a 48h gamejam) along a few others now...
-    4) **(wp_*)** Websites with Wordpress. Creating Custom Design images into a coded theme.
