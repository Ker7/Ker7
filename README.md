- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ker7 or Kert Mõttus /* Pseudo-code start here: */
- protected void *kerts_life(Family, Social, Code, Music, Meditaion, Health, Creation, Administration);
- 👀 I’m interested in Joy. For me it means Pleasure & Experience, Learning & Harmony.
      Optim(al)ism and appropriate Pessimism for Wholeness(<- ain't this´word more cliché than "True Love"?)
      My type is Projector and thankfully my upbringing has somewhat kept my curious child alive.
      So Here I am, fulfilling my dreams and helping other's on the same path we all are: SelfRealization and Integration.
-    My Code Babies:
-    1) **(tdm_*)** "Doti" Time Direction Management | Energy Focusing Helperwheel for Ultra-Open people like myself (LaravelPHP)
-    2) **(gd_*)** 50+ of game prototypes written in GameMaker Language (it's how I entered the coding world, is my python..)
-    3) To emphasize the point one, so far  have I finished a Pong game and a conversation-game (at a 48h gamejam) along a few others now...
-    4) **(wp_*)** Websites with Wordpress. Creating Custom Design images into a coded theme.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Clang, App development, Music production and Flow in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Awareness & Data Visualizations.
